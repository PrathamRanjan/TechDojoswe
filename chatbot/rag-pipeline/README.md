# RAG Pipeline

Okay, you need to create a virtual environment. Just run `install requirements`, put in your Pinecone and API key, and then they create a folder called `data` with a subfolder called `pdf`. Whatever PDF you want to do, and you can run the rag part on it, the upsetting data part of it, in the notebook.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Add your Pinecone and OpenAI API keys to the notebook
4. Create a folder structure: `data/pdf/`
5. Put your PDFs in the `data/pdf/` folder
6. Run the notebook to embed and query your PDFs
